# Advanced Supabase Optimization Plan

## Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations

### 1. Database Indexing Optimization
- Create composite indexes for frequently queried columns
- Optimize JOIN operations with proper indexing
- Add partial indexes for filtered queries

### 2. Supabase Edge Functions for Complex Queries
- Move complex aggregations to server-side
- Reduce data transfer with computed results
- Implement server-side filtering and sorting

### 3. Real-time Subscriptions Optimization
- Selective real-time updates
- Batched subscription updates
- Smart reconnection strategies

### 4. Advanced Caching Strategies
- Multi-level caching (memory + localStorage)
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Predictive data loading

## Implementation Priority
1. Database indexes (immediate impact)
2. Edge functions for heavy queries
3. Advanced caching layer
4. Real-time optimization

## Expected Results
- 60-80% reduction in egress usage
- Improved query performance
- Better user experience
- Reduced costs
