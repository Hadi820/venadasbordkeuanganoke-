# Problem Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Interface Mismatches

**Problem**: Missing properties in component interfaces causing compilation errors.

**Fixed**:
- Added `onRecordPayment` property to `ClientsProps` interface in `components/Clients.tsx`
- Removed unused `onUpdateRevision` prop from `PublicRevisionForm` component usage in `App.tsx`

### 2. Missing Form State Properties

**Problem**: Project form state was missing several properties that exist in the Project interface.

**Fixed in `components/Projects.tsx`**:
- Added `transportPaid: false` to initial form state
- Added `transportNote: ''` to initial form state  
- Added `printingCardId: ''` to initial form state
- Added `transportCardId: ''` to initial form state

### 3. Type Safety Improvements

**Fixed**:
- Added proper type annotations for function parameters in `App.tsx`
- Ensured all Project interface properties are properly initialized in form state

## Result

✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
✅ Build process completes successfully
✅ No runtime type errors
✅ Maintained backward compatibility

## Files Modified

1. `App.tsx` - Fixed prop passing and type annotations
2. `components/Clients.tsx` - Added missing interface property
3. `components/Projects.tsx` - Added missing form state properties

The application now compiles cleanly and all egress optimization features remain intact.
